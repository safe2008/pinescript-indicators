# Fractal Model

`Fractal Model` is a TradingView tool for marking a multi-timeframe reversal sequence. It projects selected higher-timeframe candles beside the active chart, watches their highs and lows for a sweep, then maps the confirmation and target levels that follow.

It is a visual-analysis tool. It does not place orders or guarantee a trade outcome.

## The Model In One View

The script looks for this sequence:

```text
Higher-timeframe level -> sweep -> close back through the level -> C2 -> CISD -> projections / trade plan
```

The higher-timeframe high or low is the reference point. A sweep alone is not enough: the candle must close back through the swept level to create a reversal candidate. The script labels that candidate `C2`, then waits for a lower-timeframe change in delivery (`CISD`) before treating the setup as confirmed.

## Bullish Sequence

1. Price trades below a prior higher-timeframe low.
2. The active candle closes back above that low.
3. The script identifies the reversal candle as a bullish `C2` candidate.
4. A later close above the calculated CISD level confirms the move.
5. Optional liquidity lines, projection levels, and position-sizing boxes help frame the next upside objective.

## Bearish Sequence

1. Price trades above a prior higher-timeframe high.
2. The active candle closes back below that high.
3. The script identifies the reversal candle as a bearish `C2` candidate.
4. A later close below the calculated CISD level confirms the move.
5. Optional liquidity lines, projection levels, and position-sizing boxes help frame the next downside objective.

## Calendar Level Sequence

Independent of the `Fractal` selector, the script can also track the prior day, week, and month's high and low as a fixed calendar-period reference — `Calendar High` / `Calendar Low`, labeled on chart as `PDH`/`PDL`, `PWH`/`PWL`, and `PMH`/`PML`. Turn Day, Week, and Month on individually; each runs its own Sweep -> C2 -> CISD track, entirely separate from the Fractal HTF track and from the other Calendar periods.

```text
Prior day/week/month high or low -> sweep -> close back through the level -> C2 -> CISD confirmed
```

1. Price trades beyond the prior period's high (bearish) or low (bullish).
2. The active candle closes back through that level, and the script marks the reversal candidate as `C2`.
3. The script tracks the swing extreme and the CISD level candle-by-candle from there, the same way it does for the Fractal HTF track.
4. Once price closes through the CISD level, the setup is confirmed in a single step. Calendar Levels don't wait on additional candle closes the way the Fractal HTF `C2 -> C3 -> C4` sequence does — there's no higher-timeframe candle series for a Calendar Level to advance through, so confirmation and the projection anchors are set together as soon as CISD triggers.
5. A confirmed-pending setup keeps tracking its originally swept level even if the calendar period rolls over (a new day, week, or month starts) before confirmation. Only later sweeps use the new period's high/low.

Calendar Levels reuse the model's global `Bias` filter and projection settings rather than adding separate copies. Sweep and CISD-confirmation alerts fire per period and direction through the same dynamic alert (see `Alerts?` below) the Fractal HTF track uses — there is no separate alert entry per Calendar period. Calendar Levels don't add a candle-projection panel, formation-liquidity lines, or entry-zone boxes of their own.

## What The Script Draws

### Higher-Timeframe Candle Projection

The panel on the right of the chart is a compact view of higher-timeframe candles. It gives the sweep logic a visible reference without requiring a separate chart window.

### Sweep And C2 Marking

When price sweeps a projected high or low and returns through it on close, the script marks the sweep and tracks the corresponding C2. A setup that later breaks its invalidation point can be marked as `xC2`.

### CISD Level

The CISD line is the script's confirmation level. It is derived from the candles around the setup and acts as the boundary price must close through before the script considers the reversal confirmed.

### Projection Levels

After confirmation, the script can draw range-based projection levels from the setup. The default values are `0`, `1`, `-1`, `-2`, and `-2.5`. Treat these as charting reference levels, not predicted prices.

### Formation Liquidity And Position Sizer

The optional formation-liquidity lines mark selected C1/C0 levels. The position sizer uses the CISD, C2 extreme, and configured risk/reward ratio to draw a visual entry, stop, and target plan.

### Calendar Level Lines And Setups

When a Day, Week, or Month track is enabled, the script draws a line at that period's prior high and low, labeled `PDH`/`PDL`, `PWH`/`PWL`, or `PMH`/`PML`. Sweep lines, `C2` labels, the CISD line, and (if enabled) projection levels for Calendar Level setups use their own color settings, kept separate from the Fractal HTF colors. Calendar Levels don't draw a higher-timeframe candle-projection panel, formation-liquidity lines, or entry-zone/position-sizer boxes — those stay specific to the Fractal HTF track.

## Settings To Start With

| Setting | Suggested starting point | What it changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Fractal` | `Automatic` | Selects the higher-timeframe relationship. |
| `Bias` | `Neutral` | Shows bullish and bearish setups. |
| `Show Sweeps` | On | Shows sweep lines and live setup tracking. |
| `Show CISD` | On | Shows the confirmation level. |
| `Enable Projections` | Off at first | Adds range-based target references after confirmation. |
| `Enable Position Sizer` | Off at first | Adds visual entry, risk, and reward boxes. |
| `Calculate on Close` | On | Uses confirmed candles and can reduce live-chart workload. |
| `Day` / `Week` / `Month` (Calendar Levels) | Off at first | Enables an independent Sweep -> C2 -> CISD track for that period's prior high/low. |
| `Show Levels` (Calendar Levels) | On | Shows the `PDH`/`PDL`-style reference line for each enabled period. |
| `Show Sweeps` (Calendar Levels) | On | Shows sweep lines and live setup tracking for Calendar Level setups. |
| `Show CISD` (Calendar Levels) | On | Shows the confirmation level for Calendar Level setups. |
| `Show Projections` (Calendar Levels) | Off at first | Adds range-based target references after a Calendar Level setup confirms. |

## Using It In TradingView

1. Open the [Pine Script source](fractal-model.pine) and copy it into a new TradingView Pine editor script.
2. Add the script to a chart.
3. Begin with automatic fractal selection and neutral bias.
4. Review a completed sweep and C2 before enabling projections or position sizing.
5. Test the model across symbols and timeframes before relying on it in a trading workflow.

- `bearish-sequence.png`: sweep above a higher-timeframe high, C2, and CISD confirmation.
- `projections.png`: projection levels after a confirmed setup.
- `position-sizer.png`: entry, stop, and target boxes.
